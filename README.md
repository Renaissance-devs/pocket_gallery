## Overview

Pocket gallery is a web application that utilizes the Havard Art Museum API. Users can search for works by title or artist. Users can also create their own galleries to which they can save specific pieces to that are returned from the API. Users can update a work and it's details as well as which gallery it belongs to.

## Problem Domain

People like art from a variety of artists, time periods, etc but there is no way to group works of art together based on what appeals to you, regardless of the artist, culture, etc.

We aim to allow users to search through a collection of art to pick pieces to be put into custom galleries.
